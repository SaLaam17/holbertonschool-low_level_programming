# C - Singly linked lists

## Description :
Singly linked lists contain two "buckets" in one node; one bucket holds the data and the other bucket holds the address of the next node of the list. Traversals can be done in one direction only as there is only a single link between two nodes of the same list

## Compilation :
Use that command line to compile:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Requirements :
All the files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
Files use the Betty style. They were checked using 
betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
