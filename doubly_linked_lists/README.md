# C - Doubly linked lists

## Description :
Doubly Linked Lists contain three "buckets" in one node; one bucket holds the data and the other buckets hold the addresses of the previous and next nodes in the list. The list is traversed twice as the nodes in the list are connected to each other from both sides.

## Compilation :
Use that command line to compile:
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

## Requirements :
All the files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc.
Files use the Betty style. They were checked using 
betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
